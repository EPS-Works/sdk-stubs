class Encoder:
    """Secure string encoder using salt-based substitution cipher.

    This class provides methods for encoding and decoding strings using a
    substitution cipher with improved security through SHA-1-based key
    generation. The encoding is reversible and suitable for storing
    sensitive data like authentication tokens.

    The security of the encoding depends on the length and complexity of
    the salt string used during initialization.

        The salt string is used to generate a cryptographic key through
        SHA-1 hashing. This key is then used for the substitution cipher,
        making the encoding more secure than simple character substitution.

        Args:
            salt: A string used to generate the cryptographic key. Longer
                 and more complex salts provide better security.
